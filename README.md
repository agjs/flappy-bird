# Flappy Bird - PhaserJS

This is my first attempt at building games in PhaserJS. I always had an intrest into game development but never really bothered much.

Don't expect too much out of this repository. It will serve me to decypher any game development concepts. It might take a year to check them all out and implement them in some meaningful and fun way.
